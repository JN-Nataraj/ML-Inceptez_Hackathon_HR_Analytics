# HR Promotion Prediction – ML Inceptez Hackathon
This project focuses on analyzing employee data and building a machine learning model to predict employee promotion.
The solution includes model training, API deployment using FastAPI, and a user-friendly UI built with Streamlit, all deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
📊 Project Overview
The project consists of three major components:
1. **Data Analysis & Model Building**
   * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   * Feature engineering and preprocessing
   * Model training and evaluation
   * Final model selection for promotion prediction
2. **Model Deployment (FastAPI)**
   * Trained model exposed as a REST API
   * Accepts employee details as input
   * Returns promotion prediction and probability
3. **User Interface (Streamlit)**
  * Simple UI for entering employee details
  * Consumes the FastAPI endpoint
  * Displays prediction results interactively
